# Palindrome_AKA
this program will check a string is palindrome or not, then it will count the total iterative and recursive run time and the ratio so the program can make a table in csv form

read this instruction to use the program

1. download the palindorme.zip file then extract it
2. use a cpp compiler (code blocks recomended)
3. open your compiler then open the palindrome program that you just downloaded
4. to open the palindrome program, inside the palindrome folder choose palindrome.cbp
5. then you can run the program via the compiler
6. after you open the program it will ask to you to put how many strings that you want to input
7. after that you can input your strings and the program will give you the information if the string is palindrome or not also with the iterative running time and the recursive running time
8. after you are don with the input, the program will give you a ressult.csv file, you can look for it inside the same folder of the program
9. lastly you can put that csv file into excel so you can analyze the total runing time
