# Palindrome_AKA
This project checks whether a given string is a palindrome using *two approaches*:
1. *Iterative (two-pointer)*
2. *Recursive*

It also measures the *average execution time (nanoseconds)* for both approaches and exports the results into a *CSV file* so you can create a comparison graph (e.g., in Excel).


## Features
- ✅ Palindrome detection (Yes/No)
- ✅ Two implementations: iterative & recursive
- ✅ Benchmarking output in *nanoseconds (ns)*
- ✅ CSV export: results.csv
- ✅ Ratio calculation: *Recursive / Iterative*



read this instruction to use the program


==================INSTRUCTION HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM==================


1. download the palindorme.zip file then extract it
2. use a cpp compiler (code blocks recomended)
3. open your compiler then open the palindrome program that you just downloaded
4. to open the palindrome program, inside the palindrome folder choose palindrome.cbp
5. then you can run the program via the compiler
6. after you open the program it will ask to you to put how many strings that you want to input
7. after that you can input your strings and the program will give you the information if the string is palindrome or not also with the iterative running time and the recursive running time
8. after you are don with the input, the program will give you a ressult.csv file, you can look for it inside the same folder of the program
9. lastly you can put that csv file into excel so you can analyze the total runing time
